## Welcome to our Charity Donations Project GitHub Page!

The goal of this project was to leverage blockchain technology to create a streamlined process for individuals to donate to desired founations.  By leveraging smart contracts donated funds can be tracked on the blockchain, providing visibility to donors of where their donations are being spent.  The grand scope of this project is to ultimately empower donors and hold foundations accountable for spending. 

### Research

[Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org) was utilized to research charitable organizations and review organization ratings.  Numerous factors are considered when providing ratings, but the below outline provides a brief scope of the rankings:

  - A ranking of 4 means that more than 75% of the money raised goes to the program
  - A ranking of 3 means 66% or more of the money raised goes to the program
  - A ranking of 2 means 50% or more of the money raised goes to the program
  - A ranking of 1 means 33% or more of the money raised goes to the program
  - A ranking of 0 means 33% or less of the money raised goes to the program.
  
Following this research, we identified an opportunity to improve potential shortfalls of fund utilization, which will help organizations gain trust with donors.
